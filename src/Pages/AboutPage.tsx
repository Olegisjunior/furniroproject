          At Furniro, we love to create products and experiences that make
          everyday living fun and fabulous. Furniro products are created for
          customers who love comfort and trendy designs at accessible prices
          without compromising quality and service.
          <span className="w-full font-bold">How we started </span>As a
          refreshingly modern mattress brand, Furniro launched in 2017 to solve
          the many unmet needs of the Indian mattress shopper. Confusing jargon,
          little or no time to try the mattress, high prices, over-dependence on
          the salesperson and no return options made shopping for mattresses a
          miserable experience. By introducing the radical ‘bed-in-a-box’
          concept along with the revolutionary 100 Night Free Trial, we
          ultimately challenged the way India shops for mattresses. We
          transformed it into an easy peasy shopping experience for everyone.
          Shoppers could replace the confusing, exhausting environment of the
          traditional mattress store with the comfort of shopping at home, 24/7
          customer service and doorstep delivery. Our 100 Nights Free Trial
          meant one could take home the mattress for a test drive for full 100
          Nights before choosing to commit or avail full refund on return. Our
          unique offerings quickly made us the internet’s fastest-growing D2C
          mattress brand. We did it by sticking to a few core principles:
          Offering a fabulous product for a fair price, providing the absolute
          best customer service and with zero compromises on quality. We didn’t
          stop here. We quickly extended the Furniro way of thinking to beyond
          mattresses all things home.{" "}
          <span className="w-full font-bold ">Who we are today</span> Today,
